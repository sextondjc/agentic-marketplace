# Orchestrate C#

## Specialization

Use this skill to coordinate cross-project C# and .NET requests from one intake when work spans language design, async behavior, architecture, validation, data access, testing, and hardening.

This skill is specialized for intake, phase ownership, and unified synthesis. It does not replace deep execution guidance for any single phase.

## Objective

Produce one deterministic C# execution contract from a single intake, with explicit phase ownership, evidence expectations, and completion checks.

## Trigger Conditions

- A C# request spans more than one capability area.
- Teams need one intake instead of disconnected language, architecture, and testing workflows.
- Cross-project reuse matters more than local one-off optimization.
- A change requires explicit ownership across language, async, architecture, validation, testing, or performance.

## Scope Boundaries

In scope:

- Deterministic C# intake and phased execution planning.
- Phase-output ownership with exactly one owner per required output.
- Unified execution recommendation for mixed C# requests.

Out of scope:

- Deep implementation of any one specialized phase.
- Non-C# product areas unless they materially constrain the C# slice.
- Generic project governance unrelated to the request objective.

## Inputs

- User objective and target C#/.NET surface.
- Scope boundaries, environments, and risk level.
- Required outputs, known evidence, and delivery constraints.
- Evaluation date in ISO format (`YYYY-MM-DD`) for source freshness checks.

## Required Outputs

- Intake contract with objective, boundaries, and required outputs.
- Phase-output ownership matrix.
- Unified C# execution recommendation.
- Rejected-candidate table with deterministic reason codes.
- Closure check stating whether all required outputs are owned.

## Depth Modes

| Level | Intent | Exit Rule |
|---|---|---|
| L1 Orientation | Route one mixed C# request | One intake and one phase contract exist |
| L2 Delivery | Coordinate one cross-capability C# effort | Every required output has one owning phase |
| L3 Hardening | Support production-grade C# delivery | Risks, evidence expectations, and blockers are explicit |
| L4 Expert Standardization | Establish reusable C# operating model | Reusable intake, ownership, and routing rubric are documented |

## Capability Catalog

Use one or more phases based on request shape:

- Language and API Contract
- Async and Concurrency
- Architecture and Boundaries
- Validation and Data Integrity
- Data Access and Repository Safety
- Testing and Evidence
- Performance and Resilience
- Release and Governance Readiness

## Deterministic Workflow

1. Lock objective, risk boundary, target runtime, and required outputs.
2. Classify the request into one or more capability phases from the catalog.
3. Assign exactly one owner per required output.
4. Reject any phase plan with unowned or multiply owned outputs.
5. Define evidence expectations and handoff criteria between phases.
6. Produce one unified execution recommendation: narrow-execution, phased-execution, or stop-pending-blockers.
7. Publish closure status with residual risks and unresolved blockers.

## Phase-Output Ownership Matrix Template

| Required Output | Owning Phase | Evidence Expectation |
|---|---|---|
| Language feature and compatibility decision | Language and API Contract | TFM compatibility and feature adoption notes |
| Async behavior and cancellation decision | Async and Concurrency | Task model, cancellation, and exception behavior evidence |
| Layering and dependency boundary decision | Architecture and Boundaries | Boundary map and dependency direction checks |
| Input and model invariant decision | Validation and Data Integrity | Boundary validation and immutability evidence |
| Repository and SQL safety decision | Data Access and Repository Safety | Repository contract and parameterization notes |
| Test strategy and risk coverage decision | Testing and Evidence | Unit, integration, and edge-case coverage matrix |
| Performance and allocation decision | Performance and Resilience | Baselines, hotspots, and regression checks |
| Promotion and rollback decision | Release and Governance Readiness | Approval chain, rollback plan, and evidence bundle |

## Unified Decision Rules

- `narrow-execution`: one phase owns the meaningful work and adjacent phases are informational.
- `phased-execution`: two or more phases are required and ownership is unambiguous.
- `stop-pending-blockers`: required outputs are unowned, evidence is materially missing, or risk cannot be bounded.

## Rejected Candidate Reasons

- `R1`: Outside the C#/.NET slice.
- `R2`: Adds overlap without adding required-output coverage.
- `R3`: Expands scope beyond the bounded objective.
- `R4`: Requires evidence or environment access that is not available.
- `R5`: Better handled by a narrower single-phase workflow.

## L4 Coverage Matrix

| Requested Outcome | Skill Section |
|---|---|
| One C# intake | Objective + Deterministic Workflow |
| Phase ownership clarity | Phase-Output Ownership Matrix Template |
| Deterministic orchestration | Unified Decision Rules |
| Rejected-scope record | Rejected Candidate Reasons |
| Cross-project reusable contract | Capability Catalog + Pragmatic Stop Rule |

## Reasoning Package

Assumptions:

- Mixed C# requests are higher quality when routed through one intake with explicit ownership.
- Most requests can be reduced to a small number of bounded capability phases.

Trade-offs:

- Strong orchestration reduces drift and duplicate work but adds upfront routing overhead.
- Over-bundling can slow narrow requests that should remain in one phase.

Open blockers:

- Missing runtime constraints or release criteria can invalidate the phase plan.
- Weakly bounded objectives create overlapping ownership.

Recommendation:

- Default to `narrow-execution` for localized requests and use `phased-execution` only when more than one phase clearly owns a required output.

## Source Governance Summary

- Active sources, evaluation date, and guidance deltas are tracked in [source-catalog.md](./references/source-catalog.md).
- Freshness threshold defaults to 30 days for active source checks.

## Reference Assets

- Use [csharp-execution-contract-template.md](./references/csharp-execution-contract-template.md) when one C# request needs a reusable intake and ownership contract.

## Pragmatic Stop Rule

Stop when every required output has exactly one owner, the execution mode is explicit, and no blocker remains hidden behind ambiguous C# scope.

## Done Criteria

- Trigger conditions are satisfied.
- Required outputs are complete.
- Ownership matrix has no unowned or multiply owned outputs.
- Decision mode is explicit.
- Source catalog is current for this evaluation cycle.
